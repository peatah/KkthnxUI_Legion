KkthnxUI is a simplistic user interface that holds onto the information and functionality, while still keeping most of the good looks.
It can be used for any class or role.      

### Installation      
* Copy KkthnxUI & KkthnxUI_Config from the .zip to your World of Warcraft folder(WoW\Interface\AddOns\PLACE THEM HERE)
* Put these files  in `...C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft` Or where ever you have your World of Warcraft installed. You get the idea.   
* Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running.

### F.A.Q   
* All questions, suggestions, and bugs can be directed to me in-game or in a issues report too [Issue Report](https://github.com/Kkthnx/KkthnxUI_Legion/issues/new)      
* Once the UI reloads off the install, you can type **/settings** or **/settings all** if you prefer all the settings for addon profiles.   
* You can type /moveui and move certain features of the UI. More to come later.    
* If you find a bug, then properly make an [Issue Report](https://github.com/Kkthnx/KkthnxUI_Legion/issues/new).
